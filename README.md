#This is my small portfolio that I have put together to show competencies in programing. It is not meant to be impressive, but show that I understand basic syntax and am able to problem solve my own coding issues.

# dataset1: This uses data that I pulled from Kraggle as a way to demonstrate my knowledge of actually creating visualizations. There is minor experimentation and data cleaning, but it should show low level understanding of R.

# dataset2: This uses old piloting data from an experiment. The main purpose of this set shows that I understand the real world applications of coding and how it can be an effective tool in understanding your results. By running this code we were able to see the strengths and weaknessess for this studey and adjust the experiment.

# dataset3: I do not use python much, so this code is from a tutuorial I used for scraping twitter. This is meant to show that I understand the possibilities of python as well as how to alter existing code in a way to fit my needs.
